description: |-
  Each Cuprum::ResultList wraps an Array of Cuprum::Result objects, and itself
  implements the same methods as a Result: #status, #value, #error, and the
  #success? and #failure? predicates. As such, a Command's #process method can
  return a ResultList instead of a Result. This is useful for commands that
  operate on a collection of items, such as a MapCommand or a controller
  endpoint that performs a bulk operation.
