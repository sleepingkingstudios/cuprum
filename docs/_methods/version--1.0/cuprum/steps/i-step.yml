description: |-
  The #step method is used to evaluate a sequence of processes, and to
  fail fast and halt processing if any of the steps returns a failing
  result. Each invocation of #step should be wrapped in a #steps block,
  or used inside the #process method of a Command.

  If the object returned by the block is a Cuprum result or compatible
  object (such as a called operation), the value is converted to a Cuprum
  result via the #to_cuprum_result method. Otherwise, the object is
  returned directly from #step.

  If the returned object is a passing result, the #value of the result is
  returned by #step.

  If the returned object is a failing result, then #step will throw
  :cuprum_failed_result and the failing result. This is caught by the
  #steps block, and halts execution of any subsequent steps.

      # The result is passing, so the value is extracted and returned.
