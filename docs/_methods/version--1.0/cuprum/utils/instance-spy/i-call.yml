  Each time #call is invoked, the object performs the following steps:

  1. The #process method is called, passing the arguments, keywords, and
     block that were passed to #call.
  2. If the value returned by #process is a Cuprum::Result or compatible
     object, that result is directly returned by #call.
  3. Otherwise, the value returned by #process will be wrapped in a
     successful result, which will be returned by #call.
