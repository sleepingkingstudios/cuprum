description: |-
  If the operation cannot be run more than once, this method should raise
  an error.
short_description: |-
  Clears the reference to the most recent call of the operation, if any.
  This allows the result and any referenced data to be garbage collected.
  Use this method to clear any instance variables or state internal to the
  operation (an operation should never have external state apart from the
  last result).
