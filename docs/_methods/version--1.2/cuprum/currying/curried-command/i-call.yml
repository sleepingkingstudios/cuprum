  First, the arguments array is created starting with the :arguments
  passed to #initialize. Any positional arguments passed directly to #call
  are then appended.

  Second, the keyword arguments are created by merging the keywords passed
  directly into #call into the keywods passed to #initialize. This means
  that if a key is passed in both places, the value passed into #call will
  take precedence.

  Finally, the merged arguments and keywords are passed into the original
  command's #call method.
