  Whereas the #call method provides the public interface for calling a
  command, the #process method defines the actual implementation. This
  method should not be called directly.

  When the command is called via #call, the parameters are passed to
  #process. If #process returns a result, that result will be returned by
  #call; otherwise, the value returned by #process will be wrapped in a
  successful Cuprum::Result object.
