  When given a result, the matcher list will check through each of the
  matchers in the order they were given for match clauses that match the
  result. Each matcher is checked for a clause that matches the status,
  error, and value of the result. If no matching clause is found, the
  matchers are then checked for a clause matching the status and either the
  error or value of the result. Finally, if there are still no matching
  clauses, the matchers are checked for a clause that matches the result
  status.

  Once a matching clause is found, that clause is then called with the
  given result.

  If none of the matchers have a clause that matches the result, a
  Cuprum::Matching::NoMatchError will be raised.
