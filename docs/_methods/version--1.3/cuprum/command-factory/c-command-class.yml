description: |-
  A factory instance will define the constant ::RockClimb, and accessing
  factory::RockClimb will call the block and return the resulting command
  class. This value is memoized, so subsequent factory::RockClimb accesses
  on the same factory instance will return the same command class.

  A factory instance will define the method #rock_climb, and calling
  factory#rock_climb will access the constant at ::RockClimb and return an
  instance of that subclass of RockClimbCommand. Any arguments passed to
  the #whirlpool method will be forwarded to the constructor when building
  the command.
